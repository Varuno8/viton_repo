# Virtual Try-On E-commerce

Frontend demo built with Next.js 14 and Clerk for authentication. Products can be ingested from a Google Drive CSV and images are generated by a FastAPI service.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run prisma:generate
npm run db:push
npm run dev
```

Create `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FASTAPI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_S3=false

NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=
```

## Features

* Browse products seeded from `data/products.json`.
* Admin page ingests a Google Drive CSV link to update products.
* Upload up to three photos and start a try-on job backed by FastAPI.

## FastAPI

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_FASTAPI_BASE_URL` to your FastAPI service URL.

## Uploads

User photos are saved under `public/uploads/{userId}/` in development.
When `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_S3=true` the upload handler is a placeholder for S3 integration.

This repository is a simplified skeleton; additional UI polish, error handling, and S3 support can be added.
