# Virtual Try-On E-commerce

Frontend demo built with **Next.js 14**, **Clerk** for authentication, and **Prisma** for data access. Images are generated by an external FastAPI service and product data can be ingested from a Google Drive CSV.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run prisma:generate
npm run db:push
npm run dev
```

Create `.env.local` using `.env.example` as a reference. Required variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_FASTAPI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_S3=false
DATABASE_URL=file:./dev.db
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
ADMIN_EMAILS=founder@example.com,admin@example.com
```

## Clerk Setup

Sign up at [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) and create an application. Copy the publishable and secret keys into your `.env.local`. Without keys Clerk runs in "keyless" mode and requests will fail.

## Design System & Theming

The app uses Tailwind CSS with a minimal design system: neutral base colors, rounded cards, and responsive typography. Dark mode support and shadcn/ui components can be extended as needed.

## Features

- Browse products seeded from `data/products.csv`.
- Admin page ingests a Google Drive CSV link to update products.
- Upload up to three photos and start a try-on job backed by FastAPI.

## FastAPI

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_FASTAPI_BASE_URL` to your FastAPI service URL.

## Uploads

User photos are saved under `public/uploads/{userId}/` in development. When `NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_S3=true` the upload handler is a placeholder for future S3 integration.

This repository is a simplified skeleton; additional UI polish, rate limiting, and S3 support can be added.
